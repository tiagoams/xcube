    Optimize a dataset for faster access.

    Reduces the number of metadata and coordinate data files in xcube dataset given by given by *dataset_path*.
    Consolidated cubes open much faster from remote locations, e.g. in object storage,
    because obviously much less HTTP requests are required to fetch initial cube meta
    information. That is, it merges all metadata files into a single top-level JSON file ".zmetadata".
    If *unchunk_coords* is set, it removes any chunking of coordinate variables
    so they comprise a single binary data file instead of one file per data chunk.
    The primary usage of this function is to optimize data cubes for cloud object storage.
    The function currently works only for data cubes using ZARR format.

    :param input_path: Path to input dataset with ZARR format.
    :param output_path: Path to output dataset with ZARR format. May contain "{input}" template string,
           which is replaced by the input path's file name without file name extentsion.
    :param in_place: Whether to modify the dataset in place.
           If False, a copy is made and *output_path* must be given.
    :param unchunk_coords: Whether to also consolidate coordinate chunk files.
    :param exception_type: Type of exception to be used on value errors.
